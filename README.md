# Dashboard_Analysis

In this project, I've used Power BI to analyze data from Spotify Charts. The primary objectives are to extract actionable business insights, conduct essential data transformations, generate informative tables, and culminate in the creation of an engaging and visually striking dashboard.

I'll be creating trends in music consumption, decipher regional preferences, and track changes over time. By blending data science with compelling visualization techniques, it enabled me learn skills to extract meaningful insights from real-world data and present them in a visually captivating manner, providing a valuable asset for decision-makers.
